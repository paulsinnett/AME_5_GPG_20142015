The Weekly exercises and a development log for them. 


To move the tank use the WASD or Arrow keys. To rotate the tank barrel press Q and E. To fire a shell press the space bar. 

The aim of the game is to hit as many targets as possible. (The game has no end state. So don't keep playing forever.)

There is a block at the back of the area the tank is in. Use that to reset if necessary.

It seems that in the Windows build of the game the targets spawn at a ridiculous rate. I didn't have the time to fix this before the hand in. My game project should work correctly. I can't say if the Mac one will be broken, I couldn't test it. My apologies.
